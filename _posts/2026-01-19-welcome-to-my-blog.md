Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Gonzalo, a Systems Thinker working at the intersection of technology, mathematics, and real-world problem solving. This blog will be a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Systems Thinking**: How to approach complex problems by understanding the interconnections between components
- **Technology**: My experiences building software and working as a Fractional CTO
- **Sotavento Labs**: Updates on projects and experiments
- **Amateur Radio**: My journey towards getting licensed
- **AI and the Future**: Observations on how artificial intelligence is reshaping computing

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me think. By putting ideas into words, I'm forced to clarify my thinking and challenge my assumptions. If these posts help someone else along the way, that's a bonus.
