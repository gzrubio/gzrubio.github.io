## About Me

I'm Gonzalo, a Systems Thinker with a background in Mathematics and Software Engineering.

Currently, I work as a **Fractional CTO at bmetric** and run **Sotavento Labs**, where I funnel my obsessions and crazy ideas into projects.

### What I Do

I connect systems, bridge domains, and ultimately ensure technology gets out of the way of the users. My approach is rooted in the belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.

### Current Interests

- **Sotavento Labs**: Building systems that hopefully make the world a better place
- **Amateur Radio**: Working towards my license
- **AI & Computing**: Exploring how artificial intelligence will shape the future

### Philosophy

My motto is simple: **Don't be evil.**

### Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about systems thinking, technology, or any of my current obsessions.
