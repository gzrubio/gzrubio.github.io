    <p>On the process of building this blog, I was 100% sure I wanted to follow <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/#set-up-your-blog">Ben Kuhnâ€™s advice</a> and spent as little time as possible with the set-up.</p>
<p>Another requirement I had was that the content should be owned as tightly as possible by me, this means that the content need to be produced in a fully portable format (text files, Markdown, or similar)</p>
<p>For that reason and because I have a lot of previous exposure to Python and Jinja decided to give Pelican a try. In the past I have tinkered with it, but ended up stuck in trying to make the theme to behave as I needed or stuck into the best build process of the site.</p>
<p>This time is different, this time I have the flexibility to use my own theme, and I am 100% confident I will get it to work as I need because I have AI to help me.</p>
<p>I am no expert in HTML, CSS or JS, but I am really good at understanding how all those languages are structured and built, so with AI helping with the syntax I can build almost anything I can dream of.</p>
<p>So I found <a href="https://huyenchip.com/">Chip Huyen's blog</a> design pretty neat, so let us say I want to use that as a base inspiration and then tweak it a bit:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of Claude.ai generating a full HTML+CSS working example out of a website screenshot" src="images/article1-image1.png"></p>
<p>Boom! I can literally screenshot the site and get a working CSS. It needs some adjustments to make sure the code is organized and works for my specific set-up but it saves me a huge time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a skeleton to iterate until I get the desired result</li>
<li>Learning all the CSS syntax that I will literally use once in my life (building the template)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, how is this even possible? If LLM are just probabilistic machines, how can they take images and produce a CCS that replicates it?</p>
<p>What will happen if I feed an image that has absolutely nothing to do with CSS styling? Why?</p>
