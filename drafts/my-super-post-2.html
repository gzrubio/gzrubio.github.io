    <p>While having 0 formal education in AI and Machine Learning algorithms, I am always fascinated whenever I learn something about those areas how similar it looks to how neuroscientists talk about the human brain and their internals.</p>
<p>One concept it has always fascinated me is the working memory and context switching. To keep it short, it has been scientifically proven that we humans can’t multi-task, what happens instead is that we are switching contexts so fast that it looks like we are doing two things at the same time.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the context is all the neural paths that our brain has recognized as needed for the execution of a task, and the more focused we are in a single activity the warmer those paths are and the more efficient this task gets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we are constantly switching between contexts, the involved neural paths never get iterations enough to get warm causing a significant overhead in resource utilization.</p>
<p>So…why the fuck I am talking about this, because I have always hate how little my context window was for me. I can focus relatively easy, but the amount of information and context I can’t fit in my brain is relatively small.</p>
<p>LLMs are tremendous at handling a huge amount of information, so what if I could select a curated amount of resources and use those as anchors in my mental processes?</p>
<p>Let us say I am writing an essay or a this post, I know that well-known resources on writing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elements of style - William Shrunk?</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But the amount of information in these books is huge. If I wanted to incorporate the techniques described in my writing I would have to read them, study them somehow, not to speak about making sure I do not forget about the content.<br>
On the other hand AI is extremely good at handling huge amounts of diverse information, so what if I could instruct the AI to use those resources to guide me? Do not get me wrong, I still want to do the process of writing, but having such a good guide would allow me to produce quality content since day 1 and after certain use those good techniques would become internal to me and my style of writing.</p>
<p>When I think about it is not very different on how I learned writing back at school:</p>
<p>I am given some resources and a topic to write about</p>
<p>My teacher would review those essays and provide feedback</p>
<p>The only difference now is that these feedback loops can happen at any time speed that I need. Everyone has access to the same ultra high-quality resources.</p>
<p>^^ Different idea on the same topic</p>
<p>When MOOCs and online education was launched, everyone was talking about how powerful and equalizing was to suddenly have all that learning materials available to everyone. It is very clear that some people excel at teaching others, so suddenly those extreme quality resources were available for everyone.</p>
<p>I feel like we are now in a similar moment, we are now capable to incorporate all that expert knowledge in our day-to-day processes, but only if we find a process for that copilot experience</p>
