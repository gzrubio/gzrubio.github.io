In an era where the cost of a line of code is trending towards zero, you need a systems thinker. Someone who cares not just about the technology, but about the ultimate goal and the dynamics to navigate to get there.

I've spent the last 10 years working with startups, enterprises, and universities, doing exactly that: building a consistent, unified path towards the bigger picture.
